		<p style="color:cyan";>13 February 2019 : Today, i have launched my first hand-coded website to the public, i am very happy and excited about this as i have always wanted to code my own website and show it the world. I am very happy for my site to reach as many people as it can though it still needs to be worked on alot and i am well on my way to do so. Show some support by visiting the Links tab and check out my social media there.</p>

		<p style="color:cyan";>25 February 2019 : I have updated and fixed quite a few things on my website, including some pages not redirecting at all as well as some spelling mistakes, i have also added a new section where i can have adverts running on my website. I have also added more keywords to my site for a Optimized SEO. There were missing pages in the site's redirectory so that has been fixed as well.</p>

		<p style="color:cyan";>6 March 2019 : I have worked hard on the code of my website to improve the Experience for all that visits the Website, so here is what i have done : The <a href="Links.html">Links tab</a> has been reworked to be less of a clutter. The video on the <a href="index.html">Home page</a> has been removed and replaced with a image of my profile pic. The colors on the NavMenu has been fixed so no more weird colors. Theres a new Following Count in the <a href="Links.html">Links Section</a> to see my Twitch following. The LiveView still needs to be fixed so you can see my accounts. I am sure that i have done alot of work on the website and im proud of it. If you want to see me live, come join my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/MisterTeeXD"> Twitch Livestreams</a> so you will know what im up to.</p>

		<p style="color:cyan";>8 March 2019 : Another day of work i have done to bring my content to this website, i have removed the LiveView Page since i could not fix it, the layout of the <a href="Links.html">Links Page</a> has been changed and new icons have been added, also some color issues have been fixed, i am looking to bring new content to my website and i am still searching for something, holding thumbs as i do.</p>

		<p style="color:cyan";>12 April 2019 : After a bit of a long break, i have worked on my site's SEO to maek it more discoverable, also i have changed the Background to something lighter and also the rest of the text to a lighter color so the text does not jump out on you and along with some other elements.</p>
